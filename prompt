you're ditching both the CLI and Gradio UI for now. You're aiming to use Wan2GP's models (e.g., ltxv) and just run them in a clean Python script â€” no fluff, no input prompts, no click-to-run, just direct calls.

Hereâ€™s a stripped-down task plan to turn Wan2GPâ€™s messy app into a simple script-based workflow:

âœ… Goal:
Run something like:

```bash
python run_ltxv.py
```
And it generates a video using the ltxv model and saves it somewhere â€” maybe output/output.mp4.

ðŸ“‹ TASK LIST: Run ltxv in a Minimal Script
1. Set Up Script Layout
2. Extract Core Logic
4. Hardcode or Config Inputs
    For now, just hardcode in the script:
        Prompt
        Output filename
        Model weights path or HF model ID
        Sampling params (seed, steps, etc.)
5. Handle Model Weights
