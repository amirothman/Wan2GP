# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-01-02 22:32:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Current Focus

- Memory Bank initialization for WanGP video generation platform
- Understanding project architecture and capabilities
- Preparing for potential development tasks or improvements

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank system initialized
- Comprehensive project analysis completed based on README.md
- Project structure and capabilities documented
- Identified key components: Wan models, Hunyuan Video, LTX Video integration

## Open Questions/Issues

- What specific development tasks or improvements are needed?
- Are there any current bugs or performance issues to address?
- Which models or features need priority attention?
- What is the current deployment/usage status of the platform?
- Are there any compatibility issues with newer GPU architectures (RTX 50XX)?
- Performance optimization opportunities beyond current implementations?
2025-01-02 22:38:00 - New task: Create minimal script-based workflow for LTX Video model

## Current Focus

- Creating run_ltxv.py script to bypass CLI/Gradio complexity
- Using 13B distilled model for faster generation (10 steps vs 30)
- Implementing direct model calls without UI overhead
- Hardcoding optimal parameters for immediate usability

## Recent Changes

- Analyzed WanGP codebase structure and LTX Video implementation
- Identified core LTXV class and generation pipeline
- Selected 13B distilled model configuration for optimal speed/quality balance
- Designed simplified architecture removing UI dependencies

## Open Questions/Issues

- Model file availability in ckpts/ directory
- VRAM requirements validation
- Output directory creation and permissions
