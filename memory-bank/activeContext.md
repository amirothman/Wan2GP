# Active Context

This file tracks the project's current status, including recent changes, current goals, and open questions.

2025-01-02 22:32:00 - Initial Memory Bank creation and project analysis.

## Current Focus

- Memory Bank initialization for WanGP video generation platform
- Understanding project architecture and capabilities
- Preparing for potential development tasks or improvements

## Recent Changes

- Memory Bank system initialized
- Comprehensive project analysis completed based on README.md
- Project structure and capabilities documented
- Identified key components: Wan models, Hunyuan Video, LTX Video integration

## Open Questions/Issues

- What specific development tasks or improvements are needed?
- Are there any current bugs or performance issues to address?
- Which models or features need priority attention?
- What is the current deployment/usage status of the platform?
- Are there any compatibility issues with newer GPU architectures (RTX 50XX)?
- Performance optimization opportunities beyond current implementations?
2025-01-02 22:38:00 - New task: Create minimal script-based workflow for LTX Video model

## Current Focus

- Creating run_ltxv.py script to bypass CLI/Gradio complexity
- Using 13B distilled model for faster generation (10 steps vs 30)
- Implementing direct model calls without UI overhead
- Hardcoding optimal parameters for immediate usability

## Recent Changes

- Analyzed WanGP codebase structure and LTX Video implementation
- Identified core LTXV class and generation pipeline
- Selected 13B distilled model configuration for optimal speed/quality balance
- Designed simplified architecture removing UI dependencies

## Open Questions/Issues

- Model file availability in ckpts/ directory
- VRAM requirements validation
- Output directory creation and permissions
[2025-01-06 21:00:00] - Prompt Enhancer Integration in create_sample_video.py Completed

## Current Focus

- Successfully integrated T2V prompt enhancement functionality into create_sample_video.py
- Added support for Llama3_2 quantized model for prompt enhancement
- Implemented conditional enhancement with proper error handling and fallbacks

## Recent Changes

- Added imports for transformers.AutoTokenizer and ltx_video.utils.prompt_enhance_utils.generate_cinematic_prompt
- Added configuration variables: ENABLE_PROMPT_ENHANCER, LLM_ENHANCER_MODEL_DIR, LLM_ENHANCER_MODEL_FILE
- Implemented model loading logic with wgp.offload.fast_load_transformers_model support and fallback handling
- Added prompt enhancement call before video generation with proper seeding
- Enhanced prompts are logged and used for video generation
- Maintains compatibility with existing create_sample_video.py functionality

## Open Questions/Issues

- Flake8 line length warnings need to be addressed (multiple lines exceed 79 characters)
- Testing needed to verify prompt enhancement works with actual Llama3_2 model
- Standard Hugging Face loading fallback for quantized models needs implementation if wgp.offload is not available
[2025-01-06 22:47:00] - LTX Video Frame Count Assertion Error Fixed

## Current Focus

- Fixed critical AssertionError in LTX Video pipeline: "assert n_frames % 8 == 1"
- Corrected video_length parameter in create_sample_video.py from 240 to 241
- LTX Video pipeline now has valid frame count that satisfies 8k+1 constraint

## Recent Changes

- Updated create_sample_video.py line 122: video_length 240 â†’ 241 with explanatory comment
- Added comprehensive documentation to Memory Bank about LTX Video frame count requirements
- Identified that LTX Video requires specific frame patterns (1, 9, 17, 25, 33, 41, 49, 57, 65, 73, 81, 89, 97, 105, 113, 121, 129, 137, 145, 153, 161, 169, 177, 185, 193, 201, 209, 217, 225, 233, 241, etc.)

## Open Questions/Issues

- Video generation testing needed to confirm fix resolves the AssertionError
- Flake8 line length warnings remain in create_sample_video.py (21 violations)
- Potential need for additional frame count validation in other scripts
